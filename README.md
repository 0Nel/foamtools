# foamtools

This repository contains tools i've written over the years to ease working with OpenFOAM.

For detailed documentation, see the doc folder (which is probably still empty). 

Feel free to email me. The Code may be downloaded, shared, modified or fed to cute bunnys. I simply don't mind, though, i's appreciate bug fixes and/or pull request in general
